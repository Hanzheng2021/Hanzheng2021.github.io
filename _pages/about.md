**We welcome students (both undergrad and graduate) with interests in topics related to computer security and privacy, including system security/side channels/data privacy/trusted execution environments/privacy-preserving technologies etc. Please drop me an [email](mailto:guoxingchen@sjtu.edu.cn) for more information.**

Short Bios
------
I am currently an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) of [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) (SJTU). Before joining SJTU in March 2021, I was a research scientist at Facebook, Inc. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Ohio State University in 2019. My advisors are [Prof. Ten H. Lai](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lai.1/) and [Prof. Yinqian Zhang](http://yinqian.org/). I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees from SJTU in 2013 and 2010 respectively.
